            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <p>Are you ready for a adventure race in the outer space?<br>
                First you have to choose what spaceship you want to travel in, you can choose between 3 colours of ships in the "Start game" button.
                After that, you are ready to start! 
                But watch out for the andriods out there. If you play the game on a desktop or laptop, 
                you move your spaceship with help of you mouse or touchpad, and click right or left on the 
                gameboard where you want to move your ship to avoid the andriods.
                The longer you can fly, the higher your score will be! And the higher score you got,
                faster the spaceship will go so be careful!
                If you crash into a andriod, game is over and you can restart and play again to take 
                your previous record score!
